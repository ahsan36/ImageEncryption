# ImageEncryption
Image encryption using Java Swing involves creating a GUI interface to allow the user to select an image, encrypt the image, and then save the encrypted image. The GUI is implemented using the Java Swing framework, which provides various GUI components such as buttons, labels, text fields, and file choosers.
In Image Encryption we can encrypt the image using a specific key and decrypt that image using same key.
